I am a writer and researcher with interests in computational linguistics and natural language processing. I currently work as a software engineer at Paytm, and am a part-time CLMS student at the University of Washington.

I recently graduated from Delhi Technological University with a Bachelor's of Technology in Mathematics and Computing. During my undergrad years I've been lucky to work with experts in pioneering institutions, and publish papers on my research. My work has varied from speech and text processing to machine translation. I also like building things and contributing to open-source organizations - a recent contribution was to Apertium, an open-source machine translation toolkit. Currently, I am interested in the ethics of NLP and how we can make the internet a safer, more accessible place for everyone. 

Apart from this, I write on culture, entertainment and politics! I have been published by venues like FirstPost, The Hindu, Digital Spy and many others. I currently write about NLP on [Medium](selfassuredpaperreads.medium.com/), and books on [WordPress](pennyformyreviews.wordpress.com/).
